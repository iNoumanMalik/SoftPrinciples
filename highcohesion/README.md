# SoftPrinciples - Applying High Cohesion in a Hospital Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Software Engineering Principles**, focusing on the **High Cohesion Principle**.

It consists of two implementations of a **Hospital Management System**:

- ✅ **With Principle (High Cohesion)** – Code is structured into multiple classes, each handling a specific responsibility.
- ❌ **Without Principle (Low Cohesion)** – Everything is in a single class, making it harder to manage and extend.

## 🚀 Features of the Hospital Management System
✔ **Register Patient** – A patient provides their details.  
✔ **Assign Doctor** – A doctor is assigned based on the patient's illness.  
✔ **Prescribe Medication** – The doctor prescribes medicine.  
✔ **Dispense Medication** – The pharmacy gives the prescribed medicines.  
✔ **Generate Bill** – The billing department calculates the patient's charges.
